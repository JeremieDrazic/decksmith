# Decisions Log

Micro-decisions that don't warrant a full ADR. Ordered newest-first.

## [2026-03-16] — tsgolint alpha: disable `tsconfig-error` rule

**Context:** Oxlint type-aware linting via `oxlint-tsgolint` triggered a false positive on `baseUrl`
in all four app tsconfig files (`apps/api`, `apps/web`, `apps/worker`, `apps/mobile`). The error
message "Option 'baseUrl' has been removed" is a tsgolint alpha bug (tracked in
oxc-project/tsgolint#351).

**Decision:** Removed `baseUrl` from all four tsconfig files (TypeScript 5+ supports `paths` without
it). Also disabled the `tsconfig-error` rule override in `.oxlintrc.json` as a safety net.

**Impact:** `apps/*/tsconfig.json` — removed `baseUrl: "."` from `compilerOptions`. Typecheck still
passes.

## [2026-03-16] — Oxlint `unicorn/no-useless-undefined` disabled for test files

**Context:** The `mergeJsonField` test explicitly passes `undefined` to test that code path.
Oxlint's `unicorn/no-useless-undefined` rule flagged it as unnecessary, but in this context it is
intentional — we are testing a specific parameter value, not omitting it by accident.

**Decision:** Added an `.oxlintrc.json` override to disable `unicorn/no-useless-undefined` for
`*.test.ts` / `*.spec.ts` files.

**Impact:** `.oxlintrc.json` overrides section. Affects all future test files.

## [2026-03-16] — Oxlint runs at workspace root, not per-package

**Context:** The old ESLint setup used `turbo run lint` (per-package). Oxlint can run at the root
and lint the entire monorepo in one pass (~200ms), making the turbo approach unnecessary.

**Decision:** `pnpm lint` → `oxlint .` from workspace root. The turbo `lint` task remains in
`turbo.json` for per-package dev convenience (`pnpm --filter @decksmith/api lint`) but the root
command no longer goes through turbo.

**Impact:** `package.json` root scripts. CI `lint` job no longer needs Prisma generate.

## [2026-03-16] — vitest installed at workspace root + per-package (not catalog)

**Context:** Vitest is a devDependency needed by `packages/config` (for the shared base config) and
each package that has tests. Adding it to the pnpm catalog would be correct long-term, but since
only `apps/api` has tests today, installing directly avoids premature catalog entries.

**Decision:** Vitest pinned in root `devDependencies` and `apps/api` `devDependencies`. Will move to
catalog once 2+ packages use it.

**Impact:** `package.json`, `apps/api/package.json`, `packages/config/package.json`.
